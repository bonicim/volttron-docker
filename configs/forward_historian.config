    #   See vctl auth --help for all instance security options.
    #
    #   This can be retrieved either through the command:

    # destination-vip-address - REQUIRED
    #   Address of the platform that receives forwarded messages.
    #   Examples:
    #       "destination-vip": "ipc://@/home/volttron/.volttron/run/vip.socket"
    #       "destination-vip": "tcp://127.0.0.1:22916"
    # In this case, the address is the 'vip-address' of volttron1 which is defined in platform_configs/platform_config1.yml

    # required_target_agents
    #   Allows checking on the remote instance to verify peer identtites
    #   are connected before publishing.
    #
    #   Example:
    #       Require the platform.historian agent to be present on the
    #       destination instance before publishing.
    #       "required_target_agent" ["platform.historian"]

    #   This is True by default and allows the Forwarder to forward

    # cache_only
    #   Allows one to put the forward historian in a cache only mode so that
    #   data is backed up while doing operations on the destination
    #   instance.
    #
    #   Setting this to true will start cache to backup and not attempt
    #   to publish to the destination instance.
